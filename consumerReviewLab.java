        "I've always been on Android, though did strongly consider a Blackberry when I got my first smartphone. As far as cameras go though this is really gonna be down to the specific phone. They vary so wildly. I know there's plenty of vids on YouTube comparing phone cameras though so those could be helpful.",
        "I have tried pretty much all flagship phones this year, s25 ultra, fold 7, pixel 10 pro XL, one plus 13. Each time I think this is the one I realize just how buggy and unstable the experience is, both due to third party apps just lacking polish and the OS experience not being fluid. Android has way more features and flexibility but boy it is a buggy, stuttery and poorly supported mess. Third party apps feel like an after thought, with poorly designed UX, less features and tons of bugs.",
